    { question: 'What if AI-generated code is low quality?', answer: 'AI is a tool, not a replacement for engineering judgment. We use AI to accelerate the repetitive parts of development while our senior engineers make every architectural and quality decision. Every output is reviewed, tested, and validated.' },
    { question: 'Do you use AI to write all the code?', answer: 'No. AI assists with drafting, scaffolding, testing, and documentation. Senior engineers design the architecture, make technology decisions, review all output, and own the quality of the final product.' },
    { question: 'Can you train our team to use AI tools?', answer: "Yes. We offer hands-on workshops and embedded coaching for engineering teams. The goal is to make your team self-sufficient with AI-augmented workflows, not to create a dependency on us." },
    { question: 'Is AI-augmented development safe for production applications?', answer: "Yes, when done right. The key is that AI generates suggestions, not decisions. Our engineers evaluate, modify, and test every piece of code before it reaches production." },
