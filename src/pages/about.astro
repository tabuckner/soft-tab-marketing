We also scale our team to match the project, so you're never limited to one person's availability or skill set." },

  <!-- Our Story -->
  <Section>
    <Container narrow>
      <h2 class="reveal text-3xl md:text-4xl font-semibold text-primary mb-10">Our story</h2>
      <div class="reveal space-y-8 text-lg text-secondary leading-relaxed" style="transition-delay: 120ms;">
        <p>
          Soft-TAB was founded by Taylor Buckner, a software engineer who spent years building products across startups, growth-stage companies, and enterprise teams. The pattern was always the same: organizations needed senior talent that could ship fast, think architecturally, and own outcomes. Not just fill a seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soft-TAB exists to be that partner. We're a consultancy built around a simple idea: experienced engineers, augmented by AI, can deliver what would normally require a much larger and more expensive team. We don't sell hours. We sell outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We keep our teams lean and focused. Every engagement is led by senior engineers who own the architecture, the code, and the outcome. No layers of account managers. No handoffs between strangers. Just a consistent team that knows your project inside and out.
