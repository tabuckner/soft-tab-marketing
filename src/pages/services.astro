  { question: 'How is Soft-TAB different from hiring a freelancer?', answer: "Freelancers execute tasks. We own outcomes. That means strategic thinking, architecture decisions, and AI-augmented workflows, not just hours of coding. We also scale our team to match the project, so you're never limited to one person's availability or skill set." },
  { question: 'What technologies do you work with?', answer: 'Our deepest expertise is in TypeScript, Angular, React, Node.js, and NestJS, but we work across a wide range of stacks including Go, Java, Python, and more. We\'re stack-flexible and choose the right tool for your problem.' },
  { question: 'How much does this cost?', answer: "Every project is different, and we don't publish fixed pricing. We offer a free discovery call to understand your needs and provide a clear proposal with scope, timeline, and cost. Engagements range from short-term advisory to multi-month builds." },
  { question: 'Can you work with our existing team?', answer: "Absolutely. Team augmentation is one of our core offerings. We embed in your workflow, your tools, and your processes. We've done this with teams of all sizes across many industries." },
  { question: 'What does a typical engagement look like?', answer: 'It depends on the model. Project delivery has a defined scope and timeline. Fractional engineering is an ongoing partnership. Advisory is flexible hours per week. Every engagement starts with a free discovery call so we can recommend the right structure.' },
  { question: 'What if AI-generated code is low quality?', answer: "AI is a tool, not a replacement for engineering judgment. We use AI to accelerate the repetitive parts of development while our senior engineers make every architectural and quality decision. Every output is reviewed, tested, and validated." },
  { question: 'Do you use AI to write all the code?', answer: 'No. AI assists with drafting, scaffolding, testing, and documentation. Senior engineers design the architecture, make technology decisions, review all output, and own the quality of the final product.' },
