## Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

### Who Hires Soft-TAB

Soft-TAB serves a broad range of clients but thrives most with:

#### Persona 1: "The Non-Technical Founder"
- **Who**: Startup founders or business leaders with a product idea but no engineering team
- **Stage**: Pre-seed to Series A, or established SMBs launching a new digital product
- **Pain**: "We don't know where to start. We need someone to lead the technical build."
- **What they need**: A technical co-pilot who can go from concept to working product
- **Engagement**: Greenfield builds, architecture advisory, full-stack delivery
- **Budget**: $25K-$200K+ depending on scope
- **How they find us**: Referral from an investor, advisor, or past client

#### Persona 2: "The Overwhelmed CTO"
- **Who**: Technical leaders at growth-stage startups or SMBs who can't hire fast enough
- **Stage**: Series A-C startups, or established companies with growing engineering needs
- **Pain**: "We have more work than hands. We need senior talent NOW."

- **Engagement**: Team augmentation, modernization, rescue projects
- **Budget**: $15K-$50K/month ongoing
- **How they find us**: LinkedIn, referral from another engineering leader

#### Persona 3: "The AI-Curious Leader"
- **Who**: CTOs, VPs of Engineering, or business leaders who know AI can accelerate their team but don't know how
- **Stage**: Any — from startups to established enterprises
- **Pain**: "We need AI expertise. Our team isn't leveraging AI tools effectively."
- **What they need**: Someone to implement AI-augmented workflows, train their team, and/or build AI-powered features
- **Engagement**: AI tooling integration, team training, process augmentation, AI feature development
- **Budget**: Varies widely — from $10K training engagements to $100K+ implementation projects
- **How they find us**: LinkedIn thought leadership, referral, Google search for AI consulting

### Additional Lead Channels: Hiring Platforms

Soft-TAB is also open to sourcing work through vetted hiring platforms:
- **Toptal** — pre-vetted talent network, high-value clients
- **Gun.io** — curated freelance engineering marketplace
- **Similar platforms** — as relevant opportunities arise

These platforms serve as a supplement to inbound and referral leads, especially for team augmentation and embedded engineering engagements.

### Where We DON'T Fit Well (Disqualifiers)
- Companies looking for the cheapest option (offshore competition)
- Clients who want to micromanage implementation details
- Pure maintenance/support contracts with no strategic component
- Projects with no clear owner or decision-maker on the client side

## Competitive Landscape

### Who We Compete Against

| Competitor Type | Their Pitch | Our Advantage |
|---|---|---|
| **Offshore dev shops** | "We build it cheap" | Quality, communication, timezone alignment, senior talent |
| **Large consultancies** (Accenture, Deloitte) | "Enterprise scale and trust" | Speed, personal attention, no bureaucracy, cost-effective |
| **Freelancer platforms** (Toptal, Upwork) | "Vetted talent on demand" | Continuity, strategic thinking, not just code execution |
| **Boutique agencies** (Thoughtbot, Pivotal) | "Opinionated process, quality output" | AI-augmented delivery speed, flexible engagement models |
| **Other solo consultants** | "Hire me, I'm good" | Professional brand, team positioning, AI specialization |

### Our Unique Position

Soft-TAB sits at the intersection that no competitor owns:
- **Senior-level talent** (not junior/offshore)
- **AI-augmented delivery** (faster outcomes, lower cost)
- **Flexible engagement** (advisory to full build)
- **Personal attention** (you work with the decision-maker, not an account manager)
- **Project rescue expertise** (proven ability to enter chaotic projects and get them back on track)

### Competitive Gaps We Exploit

Based on analysis of 10 competitor firms (see `docs/competitor-analysis.md`):

| Gap | What Competitors Miss | Our Play |
|---|---|---|
| **Engagement transparency** | 0/10 firms explain how engagements work or show models | Show engagement models clearly (no specific pricing, but structure and expectations) |
| **Process transparency** | Nobody shows start-to-finish engagement flow | Show our flexible process: Discovery → Proposal → Kickoff → Delivery → Handoff |
| **Persona-specific messaging** | Most speak to "organizations" generically | Speak directly to each persona with tailored sections/paths on the site |
| **Anti-hype AI positioning** | Only 2/10 take this angle; most either hype or ignore AI | "AI is a tool we've mastered — not a buzzword. We don't vibe-code your app." |
| **The rescue angle** | Only 1/10 firms uses "rescue" framing | Highlight our strength at entering chaotic projects and restoring order |

## Positioning Statement

> **For** technology leaders and founders who need to build software fast and right,
> **Soft-TAB** is the engineering consultancy that
> **delivers production-grade software at startup speed**
> by combining senior engineering expertise with AI-augmented development.
> **Unlike** traditional agencies or freelance marketplaces,
> Soft-TAB provides the strategic depth of a CTO with the execution speed of a full team.

---

## Positioning Pillars

### 1. AI-Augmented Delivery
We don't just use AI — we've built our entire practice around it. We ship faster because AI accelerates every phase: architecture, coding, testing, deployment. Clients get senior-quality output at a pace that would normally require a much larger team.

**Proof points (to develop)**:
- Specific delivery timelines vs. industry averages
- Examples of AI tools used in practice
- Training engagements delivered

### 2. Senior Expertise, Not Warm Bodies
Every engagement is led by seasoned engineers, not juniors learning on your dime. We bring architectural thinking, not just code output. We make decisions that save you from costly rewrites later.

**Proof points (to develop)**:
- Years of experience
- Technologies and industries served
- Client retention / repeat engagement rate

### 3. Flexible by Design
Need a fractional CTO for 10 hours a week? A full-stack team for 6 months? An AI training workshop for your engineering org? We structure engagements around your needs, not our billing model.

**Proof points (to develop)**:
- Range of engagement types delivered
- Client testimonials about flexibility
- Engagement model options

### 4. The Rescue Factor
Some projects go sideways. Teams lose momentum, codebases become unmaintainable, timelines slip. Soft-TAB has a proven track record of entering project wastelands and getting them back on track — restoring velocity, cleaning up tech debt, and bringing order to chaos.

**Proof points (to develop)**:
- Specific rescue/turnaround stories from past projects
- Before/after metrics (velocity, deployment frequency, bug rates)
- Client testimonials about the turnaround experience

## Engagement Models (Structure Only — No Pricing)

> _The goal is to show prospective clients how we can work together without bidding against ourselves. Flexibility is the selling point — we adapt the model to the client, not the other way around._

### Model 1: Project Delivery
- **What**: We own a defined deliverable end-to-end
- **Structure**: Flexible — can be milestone-based, sprint-based, or fixed-scope depending on the project
- **Best for**: Greenfield builds, MVPs, feature development, modernization/rescue
- **Duration**: Typically weeks to months
- **Persona fit**: Non-Technical Founder, Overwhelmed CTO (rescue)

### Model 2: Fractional / Embedded Engineering
- **What**: Senior engineering capacity on a recurring basis — part-time or full-time
- **Structure**: Recurring commitment (most common: fractional/part-time on a weekly cadence)
- **Best for**: Ongoing development needs, scaling capacity, long-term partnerships
- **Duration**: Ongoing, typically month-to-month after initial commitment
- **Persona fit**: Overwhelmed CTO
- **Note**: This is the most common model clients request today

### Model 3: Advisory / Fractional CTO
- **What**: Strategic technical leadership without full-time commitment
- **Structure**: Retainer-based, flexible hours per week
- **Best for**: Architecture reviews, technology decisions, team mentoring, build-vs-buy analysis
- **Duration**: Ongoing or engagement-scoped
- **Persona fit**: Non-Technical Founder, AI-Curious Leader

### Model 4: AI Training & Workflow Integration
- **What**: Workshops, tooling setup, and hands-on coaching to bring AI into your engineering (or business) workflow
- **Structure**: Can be a one-time engagement (workshop/training) or phased rollout
- **Best for**: Teams that want to leverage AI but don't know where to start
- **Duration**: Days (workshop) to weeks (full integration)
- **Persona fit**: AI-Curious Leader

### How We Present This on the Website

We do NOT show prices. Instead, we show:
1. The four models above with clear descriptions of what each looks like
2. A "not sure which fits?" prompt that leads to the discovery call CTA
3. Enough context for prospects to self-qualify without a phone call

**What we signal without saying numbers:**
- "Engagements are structured around your needs" (flexibility)
- "We work with startups and established companies alike" (range)
- "Every engagement starts with a discovery call" (low-friction entry point)

---

## Engagement Process (Flexible Framework)

> _Our process adapts to the client. This is a rough skeleton, not a rigid methodology._

```
1. DISCOVER     →  Free discovery call. Understand the problem, the context, the goals.
2. SCOPE        →  Define what success looks like. Agree on deliverables and engagement model.
3. KICKOFF      →  Align on tools, communication cadence, and working norms.
4. DELIVER      →  Ship iteratively. Regular check-ins. Transparent progress.
5. EVOLVE       →  Handoff, extend, or pivot based on what we've learned together.
```

Each step bends to fit the client's needs. Some clients want weekly standups; others want async updates. Some projects need formal scoping; others are "just start shipping." We meet clients where they are.

### Discovery Call Details
- **Always starts free**: Initial conversation to understand the problem, goals, and fit
- **Simple projects**: Free scoping — we can give you a clear proposal after a single call
- **Complex projects**: May require a paid discovery/scoping phase (architecture planning, technical assessment) before we can provide an accurate proposal — we'll tell you upfront if that's the case
- **No surprises**: We're transparent about when scoping becomes paid work

## Differentiator: The AI Edge

This is Soft-TAB's sharpest competitive advantage in 2026. While other consultancies are *starting* to adopt AI tools, Soft-TAB has made AI-augmented development a core competency.

### Our AI Philosophy (Anti-Hype)

AI is a tool — not magic, not a replacement for engineering judgment. We use it to accelerate the repetitive and routine parts of software development while our senior engineers make every architectural, design, and quality decision.

**What we DO**: Use AI to draft code faster, automate testing, generate documentation, scaffold architecture, and train teams to do the same.

**What we DON'T do**: Blindly accept AI output, "vibe code" production applications, skip code review, or replace engineering rigor with prompts.

This anti-hype stance is a deliberate differentiator. Only 2 of 10 analyzed competitors take this approach. Most either over-hype AI or ignore it entirely.

### What This Means for Clients
- **Faster delivery**: AI-assisted coding, testing, and documentation means projects move faster
- **Lower effective cost**: Senior talent + AI tooling = output of a larger team at a fraction of the headcount cost
- **Future-proofing**: We can train your team to adopt the same AI workflows we use
- **AI feature development**: Beyond tooling — we can build AI-powered features into your product
- **Safe and responsible**: AI output is always reviewed, tested, and validated by senior engineers

### Services Under the AI Umbrella
- AI-augmented software development (we use AI to build your product faster)
- AI workflow integration (we set up AI tooling in your existing engineering processes)
- Team AI training (we teach your developers to be 2-5x more productive with AI)
- AI feature development (we build AI-powered features into your product)
- Business process augmentation (we apply AI to non-engineering workflows too)
