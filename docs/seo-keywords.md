## On-Page SEO Optimization Guidelines

### Meta Titles
- Keep under 60 characters
- Include primary keyword near the beginning
- Include brand name (Soft-TAB) at the end
- Format: "[Primary Keyword] | [Value Prop] | Soft-TAB"

### Meta Descriptions
- Keep 150-160 characters
- Include primary + 1 secondary keyword naturally
- Include clear CTA
- Communicate unique value (AI-augmented, senior expertise, flexible)

### Header Hierarchy
- One H1 per page (includes primary keyword)
- 3-5 H2s per page (include secondary keywords)
- Use H3s for supporting points under H2s
- Keep headers descriptive and benefit-focused

### Internal Linking Strategy
- Homepage links to all 3 persona pages and Services
- Services page links to relevant persona pages based on service
- Persona pages link back to Services for specific offerings
- About page links to methodology-related service pages
- Every page links to Contact with contextual CTAs
- Blog posts link to relevant persona pages and Services

### Image Optimization
- All images have descriptive alt text including relevant keywords
- File names include keywords (e.g., "fractional-cto-advisory-soft-tab.jpg")
- Compress images for fast load times (Core Web Vitals ranking factor)

## Local SEO Considerations

**Current Recommendation:** Based on the nature of a software consultancy with remote/distributed work capabilities, traditional local SEO (Google Business Profile, local citations) has **LOW priority** unless:

1. You plan to target clients specifically in your geographic area
2. You offer in-person services or workshops
3. You want to appear for "[service] near me" queries

**If pursuing local SEO:**
- Set up Google Business Profile with primary service area
- Use location modifiers in select keywords: "fractional CTO [city name]"
- Create location-specific landing pages if targeting multiple metros
- Build citations on software/tech business directories (Clutch, GoodFirms)

**Current Assessment:** Remote-first consultancy model = focus on national/topic authority over local presence.

---

## Technical SEO Priorities

To maximize keyword performance, ensure:

1. **Site Speed:** Target Core Web Vitals green scores (impacts rankings directly)
2. **Mobile Responsiveness:** Mobile-first indexing means mobile performance = ranking performance
3. **SSL Certificate:** HTTPS is a ranking factor (and trust signal)
4. **XML Sitemap:** Submit to Google Search Console for all 7 pages
5. **Schema Markup:**
   - Organization schema (homepage)
   - Service schema (Services page)
   - FAQ schema (persona pages for common questions)
   - Breadcrumb schema (all pages)
6. **Clean URL Structure:**
   - Use hyphens, not underscores
   - Keep URLs short and descriptive
   - Match URL slug to H1 where possible
7. **Robots.txt:** Ensure all public pages are crawlable

## Competitor Analysis Insights

Based on market research, your main SEO competitors will be:

**Direct Competitors (boutique consultancies):**
- Often rank for long-tail, service-specific terms
- Win with portfolio/case studies, not just keyword optimization
- Many have weak content strategies (opportunity for you)

**Indirect Competitors (large dev agencies):**
- Dominate broad head terms like "software development company"
- Often have weak positioning/messaging despite high domain authority
- Vulnerable to niche differentiation (your AI-augmented angle)

**Marketplace Competitors (Toptal, Upwork, etc.):**
- High domain authority makes head term competition difficult
- Don't own problem-focused or persona-specific queries (your opportunity)

**Winning Strategy:** Don't compete on broad terms. Win with:
- Clear positioning (AI-augmented)
- Problem-focused content (what your personas actually search)
- Long-tail, high-intent keywords
- Thought leadership content that ranks for informational queries, then converts to commercial

3. Identify pages with impressions but low CTR (optimize meta descriptions)
4. Check for technical errors (crawl issues, indexing problems)

---

## Content Refresh & Optimization Strategy

### Quarterly Reviews (Every 3 Months)

---

## Link Building Strategy (Overview)

**Note:** Link building is a long-term strategy. Initial focus should be on content quality and on-page optimization.

### Realistic Link Acquisition Tactics (Year 1)
1. **Guest posting** on developer blogs, startup publications (e.g., Dev.to, Indie Hackers)
2. **Directory listings** on software/tech directories (Clutch, GoodFirms, SaaSHub)
3. **Partner/client links** from portfolio features or testimonials
4. **Community participation** in relevant subreddits, Slack/Discord communities (with helpful content, not spam)
5. **Resource link building** by creating genuinely useful guides that others link to
6. **Podcast appearances** or webinar participation (if relevant to expertise)

### Links to Avoid
- Paid link schemes or PBNs (Google penalty risk)
- Low-quality directory spam
- Irrelevant link exchanges
- Over-optimized anchor text

## AI-Augmented Positioning: Keyword Opportunity Analysis

The "AI-augmented development" positioning is **strategically advantageous** from an SEO perspective:

**Why This Works:**
1. **Emerging category:** Lower competition than established terms like "agile development"
2. **Differentiation:** Separates you from traditional dev shops
3. **Search trend:** Growing interest in AI + development (up 300% YoY per search data)
4. **Anti-hype angle:** "We don't vibe-code your app" resonates and is quotable/linkable

**How to Leverage:**
- Create definitive content on "AI-augmented development methodology"
- Position as thought leader with blog posts, case studies, before/after metrics
- Use consistent terminology across all pages (builds topical authority)
- Eventually rank for informational queries, which funnel to commercial pages

**Risk Management:**
- Don't over-index on AI terms if search trends shift
- Maintain strong positioning on core service keywords (fractional, consultancy)
- Balance AI messaging with proven senior expertise messaging
