## Tagline Options

Pick one (or use as inspiration to create your own):

1. **"Engineering, Augmented."** — Short, punchy, nods to AI without being gimmicky ⭐ FINALIST
2. **"Build faster. Build smarter."** — Outcome-focused, implies AI advantage ⭐ FINALIST
3. ~~"Senior engineering meets AI speed."~~ — Direct, says exactly what you get
4. ~~"Your next engineering team."~~ — Positions as team, not freelancer
5. ~~"Ship it right. Ship it fast."~~ — Action-oriented, addresses both quality and speed concerns

**Final selection**: TBD — will test both finalists against design mockups to see which fits better visually and tonally.

## Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second (Business Card / LinkedIn Intro)
> Soft-TAB is a software engineering consultancy that uses AI-augmented development to ship production-grade software faster than traditional teams.

### 30-Second (Homepage Hero)
> We're the engineering partner that founders and CTOs call when they need to move fast without cutting corners. Soft-TAB combines senior development expertise with AI-augmented workflows to deliver production-ready software at startup speed — whether you need a full build, a team extension, or help bringing AI into your engineering process.

### 2-Minute (Sales Conversation)
> Soft-TAB is a software engineering consultancy built around a simple idea: senior talent plus AI-augmented development equals outcomes that would normally require a much larger, more expensive team.
>
> We work with founders who need a technical co-pilot to take their product from concept to launch, CTOs who need senior engineers embedded in their teams yesterday, and technology leaders who want to unlock the productivity gains that AI tooling makes possible.
>
> What makes us different? Two things. First, every engagement is led by experienced engineers who think strategically — we don't just write code, we make architecture and technology decisions that save you from costly mistakes. Second, AI-augmented development isn't a line item on our website — it's how we work every day. That means faster delivery, higher quality, and a team that can show yours how to work the same way.
>
> We're flexible in how we engage — from fractional CTO advisory to full-stack project delivery to AI training workshops — and we structure everything around what you actually need.

## Objection Handling (FAQ Content)

| Objection | Response Direction |
|---|---|
| "You're just one person, not a team" | We bring in specialized subcontractors as needed. You get a senior lead (me) plus the right specialists for your project. Every engagement has a consistent point of contact who owns the outcome. |
| "How is this different from hiring a freelancer?" | Freelancers execute tasks. We own outcomes. We bring strategic thinking, architecture decisions, and AI-augmented workflows — not just hours of coding. |
| "What if AI-generated code is low quality?" | AI is a tool, not a replacement for engineering judgment. We use AI to accelerate the repetitive parts while our senior engineers make every architectural and quality decision. The result is faster delivery with the same (or higher) quality bar. |
| "What technologies do you work with?" | We're stack-flexible — [list primary technologies]. We choose the right tool for your problem, not force-fit our favorite framework. |
| "How much does this cost?" | Every project is different. We offer free discovery calls to understand your needs and provide a clear proposal. Typical engagements range from short-term advisory to multi-month builds. |
| "Can you work with our existing team?" | Absolutely. Team augmentation is one of our core offerings. We embed seamlessly into your workflow, tools, and processes. |

## Writing Style Guide (Quick Reference)

- **Voice**: Confident, technical, approachable
- **Person**: "We" (not "I" — reinforces team positioning)
- **Audience address**: "You" / "Your" (second person, direct)
- **Sentences**: Mix short and long. Lead with short.
- **Jargon**: Use technical terms correctly but explain when needed
- **Avoid**: "Leverage," "synergy," "paradigm," "bleeding-edge," "disrupt"
- **CTA language**: Action verbs — "Schedule," "Start," "Build," "Talk" (not "Submit," "Click here")
