## Section 1: Hero

**Headline**:
AI is a tool, not magic. We'll show you how to use it.

**Subheadline**:
We help engineering teams and businesses adopt AI the right way: real productivity gains, not buzzword bingo.

## Section 2: The Anti-Hype Promise

**Section headline**: Let's cut through the noise.

Everyone's talking about AI. Most of them are selling hype.

We use AI every day to ship software faster. We don't vibe-code your production app. AI accelerates the routine. Senior engineers make the decisions that matter.

We'll be honest about what AI can and can't do for your specific situation. That honesty is why clients trust us.

## Section 3: How We Help with AI

**Section headline**: What we do for AI adoption

### AI-Augmented Development
We use AI to build your product faster. You get the speed without the risk, because every line of AI-assisted output is reviewed and validated by senior engineers.

### Team AI Training
Hands-on workshops that teach your developers to be 2-5x more productive with AI coding tools. Not slides and theory. Real workflows, real tools, real results your team can apply the next day.

### Workflow Integration
We set up AI tooling in your existing engineering processes: CI/CD, code review, documentation, testing. Integrated into how your team already works, not bolted on as an afterthought.

### Business Process Augmentation
AI isn't just for code. We help apply it to operations, support, content, and other workflows where automation can free your team to focus on higher-value work.

### AI Feature Development
Build AI-powered features into your product: search, recommendations, automation, natural language interfaces. We handle the engineering so your team can focus on the product vision.

**Step 5: Measure**
We track the actual productivity impact and adjust. If something isn't working, we change course.

We're not trying to create a dependency. The goal is for your team to be better at their jobs long after the engagement ends.

**We'll tell you when AI isn't the answer.**
Not every problem needs AI. We'll recommend the right solution, even when it's the simpler one.
