## Section 4: The Soft-TAB Difference

**Section headline**: Why teams choose us

### Differentiator 1: AI-Augmented Delivery
**Headline**: AI is how we work, not what we sell.
**Body**: Every engagement benefits from AI-augmented development workflows. We ship in weeks what traditionally takes months, without cutting corners on quality. AI handles the routine. Our senior engineers make the decisions that matter.

### Differentiator 2: Senior Expertise, Not Warm Bodies
**Headline**: You work with the decision-maker.
**Body**: No account managers. No junior developers learning on your dime. Every engagement is led by experienced engineers who think architecturally and own the outcome.

### Differentiator 3: The Rescue Factor
**Headline**: We thrive where others have failed.
**Body**: Some projects go sideways. Codebases become unmaintainable. Timelines slip. We have a track record of entering project wastelands and restoring velocity, cleaning up tech debt, and getting teams shipping again.
