## Section 3: Engagement Models

**Section headline**: How we engage
**Section subheadline**: We don't force-fit your needs into our billing model. Pick the structure that works for you, or let us recommend one.

### Model 1: Project Delivery
**Headline**: Project Delivery
**Body**: We own a defined deliverable end-to-end. You get a clear scope, milestones, and regular progress updates. Best for greenfield builds, MVPs, and feature development with a defined finish line.

### Model 2: Fractional / Embedded Engineering
**Headline**: Fractional & Embedded Engineering
**Body**: Senior engineering capacity on a recurring basis, part-time or full-time. We plug into your workflow and ship alongside your team. Best for ongoing development needs and long-term partnerships. This is our most common engagement model.

### Model 3: Advisory / Fractional CTO
**Headline**: Advisory & Fractional CTO
**Body**: Strategic technical leadership without the full-time commitment. Architecture reviews, technology decisions, team mentoring, and build-vs-buy analysis on a flexible schedule. Best for founders and teams that need experienced guidance.

### Model 4: AI Training & Integration
**Headline**: AI Training & Integration
**Body**: Workshops, tooling setup, and hands-on coaching to bring AI into your engineering workflow. Can be a one-day workshop or a phased rollout across your team. Best for teams ready to unlock the productivity gains that AI tooling makes possible.

**Section CTA**: Not sure which model fits? Every engagement starts with a conversation.
**CTA Button**: Schedule a Discovery Call

## Implementation Notes

### SEO Integration
- H1 captures the page's value prop; "fractional software development services" woven into hero subheadline and engagement models
- "Greenfield software development" appears in Custom Software section
- "Software team augmentation services" reflected in Team Augmentation section title and body
- "Fractional CTO advisory" appears in Advisory section and engagement model
- Internal links to persona pages from "Who it's for" lines
- Link back to homepage and to /contact

### Content Density
- Hero: ~30 words
- Each service category: ~80 words (headline + body + bullets + "who it's for")
- Each engagement model: ~40 words
- Technologies: ~30 words intro + logo grid
- Total estimated word count: ~700 words of visible copy

### Structural Notes
- Service categories should be visually distinct cards/blocks with icons
- Engagement models can be a simpler grid (no icons needed, just headline + body)
- Technologies section should feel lightweight — logo grid, not paragraphs
- Consider alternating layout for service categories (image left/right) if the design supports it

### Placeholder Items to Resolve
1. **Technology list**: Owner to confirm which technologies to actively market
2. **"Who it's for" links**: These lines could link to the relevant persona pages
3. **Case study callouts**: Once case studies exist, each service category could link to a relevant one
