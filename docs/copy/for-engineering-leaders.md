## Section 3: How We Help Engineering Leaders

**Section headline**: What we do for engineering teams

### Team Augmentation
Senior engineers who embed in your team, your tools, your standup. We match your workflow and ship alongside your people. No ramp-up theater.

### Project Rescue
We enter the wasteland, assess the damage, and get things back on track. Restoring velocity, cleaning up tech debt, and rebuilding confidence in the codebase. We've done this more times than we'd like to admit.

### Architecture and Code Review
Fresh senior eyes on your system design. We identify risks, recommend improvements, and help your team make decisions they'll be glad about in two years.

### Modernization
Migrate, refactor, or rebuild legacy systems without stopping the train. We plan the transition, execute incrementally, and keep your team shipping throughout.
