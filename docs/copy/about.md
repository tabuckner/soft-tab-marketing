## Section 1: Hero

**Headline**:
Built by engineers. Driven by outcomes.

**Subheadline**:
Soft-TAB is a boutique software consultancy that pairs senior engineering expertise with AI-augmented development. We build software the way it should be built: fast, right, and with no surprises.

## Section 2: Our Story

**Section headline**: Our story

**Paragraph 1**:
Soft-TAB was founded by Taylor Buckner, a software engineer who spent years building products across startups, growth-stage companies, and enterprise teams. The pattern was always the same: organizations needed senior talent that could ship fast, think architecturally, and own outcomes. Not just fill a seat.

**Paragraph 2**:
Soft-TAB exists to be that partner. We're a consultancy built around a simple idea: experienced engineers, augmented by AI, can deliver what would normally require a much larger and more expensive team. We don't sell hours. We sell outcomes.

**Paragraph 3**:
We keep our teams lean and focused. Every engagement is led by senior engineers who own the architecture, the code, and the outcome. No layers of account managers. No handoffs between strangers. Just a consistent team that knows your project inside and out.

**Body**:
Every engagement follows a flexible framework: Discover, Scope, Kickoff, Deliver, Evolve. The details bend to fit your team. Some clients want weekly standups. Others want async updates. We meet you where you are.

## Section 4: Our Values

**Section headline**: What drives us

### Quality over speed (but why not both?)
We don't cut corners to hit deadlines. AI-augmented workflows let us move fast without sacrificing the engineering rigor that keeps projects healthy long-term.

### Transparency by default
No surprises on scope, timeline, or cost. If something changes, you hear it from us first.

### Outcomes, not hours
We measure success by what we deliver, not how long we sat at a desk. Every engagement is structured around results you can see and use.

### Honest about AI
AI is a powerful tool and we use it every day. But we don't pretend it replaces engineering judgment. We'll tell you where AI helps, where it doesn't, and why that distinction matters.

## Implementation Notes

### SEO Integration
- "Boutique software consultancy" in hero subheadline
- "AI-augmented development" woven into story and values
- "Senior software engineer consultant" reflected in story and credibility signals
- Internal links to /services (engagement models, technologies) and /contact

### Deduplication Strategy
- **"How We Work" process**: Lives in full on the homepage. This page summarizes in one sentence and links to /services for engagement model details. No step-by-step duplication.
- **Technologies**: Full list lives on /services. This page shows a one-line summary and links out.
- **Differentiators vs. Values**: Homepage "Why teams choose us" focuses on *competitive advantages* (AI delivery, senior expertise, rescue factor). This page's values focus on *principles* (quality, transparency, outcomes, AI honesty). Distinct angles, minimal overlap.

### Content Density
- Hero: ~30 words
- Story: ~120 words (3 paragraphs)
- How We Work: ~50 words (summary + link)
- Values: ~90 words (4 values)
- Credibility: ~30 words + stats/tags
- Total estimated word count: ~350 words

### Placeholder Items to Resolve (True Up Phase)
1. **Story paragraphs**: Owner to review and personalize
2. **Stats**: Verify real numbers
3. **Industry list**: Confirm which industries to claim
4. **Testimonials**: Add when available
5. **Photo**: Consider a professional headshot for this page
