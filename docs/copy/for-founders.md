## Section 3: How We Help Founders

**Section headline**: What we do for founders

### MVP and Product Development
Build your product from concept to launch. We handle architecture, development, and deployment so you get a working product, not a pile of code. Every build is designed for iteration, because what you learn after launch matters more than what you assume before it.

### Technical Co-Pilot
Ongoing guidance on the decisions that shape your product's future: technology choices, vendor evaluation, hiring your first engineers, and avoiding the expensive mistakes that set startups back months.

### Fractional CTO
Part-time technical leadership for founders who need strategic direction without a full-time executive hire. Architecture planning, team oversight, and a trusted voice in the room when it counts.

**Step 3: Build**
We ship iteratively. You see progress every week, not just at the end. No black boxes.

**Step 4: Launch and handoff**
We help you go live and set you up for what comes next, whether that's an ongoing partnership or handing off to an internal team.

**Closing line**: You'll never be left in the dark.
