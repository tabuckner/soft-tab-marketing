## Implementation Notes

### SEO Integration
- H1 is conversational and action-oriented (matches transactional intent)
- "Fractional software engineer" and "software development quote" reflected in meta description
- Minimal body copy on this page — form is the focus
- Internal links from every other page's CTA point here

### Layout Notes
- Two-column layout on desktop: form on left, "Prefer to talk?" + "What to expect" stacked on right
- Single-column on mobile: form first, then alternatives below
- Keep the page short — this is a conversion page, not a content page

### Content Density
- Total visible copy: ~120 words (intentionally minimal)
- The form does the talking — surrounding copy exists to reduce friction and set expectations

### Placeholder Items to Resolve
1. **Calendly link**: Set up and embed
2. **Formspree**: Create account and connect form
3. **"How did you hear about us?" options**: Finalize dropdown values
4. **Success state**: Design a confirmation message or redirect after form submission (e.g., "Thanks! We'll be in touch within one business day.")
