## Page-by-Page Content Outline

### Homepage (`/`)

The homepage is the front door. It must do 3 things in under 10 seconds:
1. Communicate what Soft-TAB does
2. Help the visitor self-identify ("this is for me")
3. Give them a clear next step

#### Section Breakdown

**1. Hero**
- Headline: Primary value prop (tagline finalist: "Engineering, Augmented." or "Build faster. Build smarter.")
- Subheadline: 1-2 sentences expanding on the headline — outcome-focused
- Primary CTA: "Schedule a Discovery Call"
- Secondary CTA: "See How We Work"
- Visual: TBD (abstract/gradient background, subtle animation, or illustration)

**2. "Who We Help" — Persona Routing Cards**

  3. **Build** — We ship iteratively. You see progress every week, not just at the end.
  4. **Launch & handoff** — We help you go live and set you up for what comes next (whether that's ongoing partnership or handing off to an internal team).

## Navigation Structure

**Desktop**: Horizontal nav bar
```
[Logo]  Services  About  For Founders  For Engineering Leaders  For AI Adoption  [Contact - button]
```

**Alternative** (cleaner, avoids cluttered nav):
```
[Logo]  Services  Who We Help ▾  About  [Contact - button]
                  ├── For Founders
                  ├── For Engineering Leaders
                  └── For AI Adoption
```

**Mobile**: Hamburger menu with all pages listed

**Recommendation**: The dropdown approach keeps the nav clean while making persona pages discoverable. The "Who We Help" label also reinforces the client-centric framing.
